* Provided run_standard_client.bat for easy execution.

### 📅 Day 5
* Conducted security testing and verification of AI response integrity.
* Documented API security measures and rate limiting configurations.
* Refined input sanitization to include prompt injection detection.

### 📅 Day 6
* Implemented **Prompt Tuning** for enhanced ESG compliance analysis.
* Externalized system prompts to `ai-service/prompts/` for better maintainability.
